# D (Data) Flip Flop Project

### About:

For this project, I created a D flip-flop circuit and used VHDL code to implement the following circuit whos outputs is *Q* and *Qb*. Flip-flop are one of the most important biulding blocks of modern digitial electronics. They act similar to memory cells.

### Note:

Flip-flops are not to be confused with latches.

### Results:
